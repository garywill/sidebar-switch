# Sidebar Switch

A switch for Firefox's native sidebar (bookmarks, history, etc). It's a slim vertical button on left of main content. 

Replace the legacy addon All in One Sidebar. You can open sidebar by clicking edge of screen.

This is a Firefox userChrome JS script.

Tested on Firefox 91.

This repo only contains the specific function, doesn't contain the code to enable userchrome scripts.
